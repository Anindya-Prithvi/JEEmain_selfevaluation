# JEEmain_selfevaluation
A simple python program for aspirants to store and analyse their performance by evaluating themselves on a timed test but without any GUI.
The program has 2 components as of now. 
  1. Answer key creator (created by the user)
  2. Analysis

Once the Answer key program has been run, the user is supposed to start with a test for JEE mains (75 questions only).
Further prompts from the program can be followed accordingly.
The program permits maximum of 10800 seconds, i.e. 3 hours for completion of test. Upon completion, the user is put up with a prompt to analyze their test by adding comments and weak/strong and things to work on.
The features of the answer key program include:
   1. Marking an answer for review
   2. Counting total questons attempted
   3. Time elapsed per question
   4. Time elapsed in total from start of the test.
upon every update.

The analysis program is a rather straight forward one to save the analysis of the user's paper just after completion of a test.
This program is a standalone too, so it can be run without running the Answer key program.
