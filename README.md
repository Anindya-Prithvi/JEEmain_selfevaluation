# JEEmain_selfevaluation
A simple python3 program for jeemain (Joint Entrance Examination) aspirants to store and analyse their performance by evaluating themselves on a timed test. This program is for those students who practice JEE papers on their own but are unable to time their attempt due to lack of software. The goal of my program is to help those aspirants and upgrade their speed. The features of the program is described below.

The program has 2 components as of now. 
  1. Answer key creator (created by the user)
  2. Analysis

Once the Answer key program has been run, the user is supposed to start with a test for JEE mains (75 questions only).
Further prompts from the program can be followed accordingly.
The program permits maximum of 10800 seconds, i.e. 3 hours for completion of test. Upon completion, the user is now given a graphical analysis of the time taken per question and after closing that the program prompts to analyze the test by adding comments and weak/strong and things to work on.

The features of the answer key program include:
   1. Marking an answer for review
   2. Counting total questons attempted
   3. Time elapsed per question
   4. Time elapsed in total from start of the test 
(this informations is supplied after every update)

*It is advised that users should familiarize themselves with the program prior to attempting the question paper.*

The analysis program is a rather straight forward one to save the analysis of the user's paper just after completion of a test.
This program is a standalone too, so it can be run without running the Answer key program.

Requires matplotlib and [PYTHON 3+](https://www.python.org/)

To install matplotlib, open command prompt/shell (windows button + r and write cmd, press enter). In the shell, write
<pre> pip install matplotlib </pre>
